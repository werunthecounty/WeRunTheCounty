    <h2>Holmdel Park</h2>
<p>
 To be honest, both cross country and track and their pros and cons; however, cross country <strong>definitely</strong> has the best courses.
    A little background before I go into them though. Almost every year, my family and I go to Maine. If you have ever been there you know just
    how cool their trails are, but if you haven't been there you totally need to go. Getting back on track, the only way to describe the first cross
    country course is like hiking in Maine. Holmdel Park is one of the hardest cross country courses in the country and lucky for me, I go there
    every Sunday in the summer for practice and about 3 times for meets throughout the year. Every Sunday my team and I run the course to get used to
    the COUNTLESS hills, the rough terrain, and distance. The Holmdel Park course is about 3.2 miles and is an incredibly nice park. I only wish
    the drive was shorter(haha). This course is extremely scenic, but don't let that fool you. Ranked
