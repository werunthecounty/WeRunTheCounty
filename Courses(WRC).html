    <h2>Holmdel Park</h2>
<p>
 To be honest, both cross country and track and their pros and cons; however, cross country <strong>definitely</strong> has the best courses.
    A little background before I go into them though. Almost every year, my family and I go to Maine. If you have ever been there you know just
    how cool their trails are, but if you haven't been there you totally need to go. Getting back on track, the only way to describe the first cross
    country course is like hiking in Maine. Holmdel Park is one of the hardest cross country courses in the country and lucky for me, I go there
    every Sunday in the summer for practice and about 3 times for meets throughout the year. Every Sunday my team and I run the course to get used to
    the COUNTLESS hills, the rough terrain, and distance. The Holmdel Park course is about 3.2 miles and is an incredibly nice park. I only wish
    the drive was shorter! This course is extremely scenic, but don't let that fool you. Ranked as one of the hardest courses in the country,
    the Holmdel Park course contains so many hills and most important, a section called the bowl. The bowl is a section where it is a huge circle
    where the first half is completely downhill (and rocky) and the second half if a VERY STEEP uphill. But that is nothing compared to the last
    100 meters of the bowl where it is almost to steep to even run up. Numerous people actually WALK up the end of the bowl because they are not 
    used to hills. And I don't know if this is just me, but I absolutely hate it when people start to walk during a race, but this is why my 
    team and I go to Holmdel every Sunday. To practice the hils. If you don't run hills all season and then you go to Holmdel... well, your 
    time will change. So I suggest practicing at Holmdel if you know that you have a race coming up there; however, be very careful because the 
    terrain is hard to navigate. For example, just last week I tripped on a root during a very steep downhill and totally fell. This can ruin
    your season if you are not careful. All in all, Holmdel is a beautiful, but difficult course.

    <h2>Jakes Branch</h2>
    <p>
    Jakes Branch is an awesome place to practice for cross country. This park has beautiful trails that are perfect to practice on,
     even if it isn't a high school cross country course. In middle school, my school would practice there every week and have our
      home meets there; however, in high school, cross country is a whole different ball game. In high school, a cross country meet
       is longer and has about 50 teams at each one, a huge difference from the duel meets we used to have in middle school. Jakes 
       Branch is not an actual cross country course, but running on the trails is definitely great practice. The website NJHiking has 
       an accurrate article about the Jakes Branch trails, <a href="https://www.njhiking.com/jakes-branch-tindey-swamp-interpretive/"target="_blank">Jakes Branch â€“ Tindey, Swamp, Interpretive Trails.</a>
       I would suggest viewing that website before traveling to Jakes Branch so you can dress appropriately and be prepared for the 
       envirement. Although it is hard to get lost, if you are running I would suggest becoming familiar with the trails, in case
     you make a wrong turn. Overall, Jakes Branch may not be an official cross country course, but is a very good place to go 
     to practice.
